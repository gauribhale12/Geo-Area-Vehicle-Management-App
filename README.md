# Geo-Area-Vehicle-Management-App

This project focuses on developing a user-friendly application for efficiently managing a car fleet within a specific geographic area. The primary goals involve creating, updating, and conducting searches based on user queries, which are seamlessly translated into attribute-based responses. The application offers diverse search functions to address common questions, such as locating the first available passenger car, listing manufacturers, and providing real-time car availability data. It also allows users to create and update car attributes while ensuring data validation, including null checks and attribute uniqueness. The project emphasizes UI design for a user-friendly experience, promising to streamline fleet management for any organization.
